            <h3>Why Edinburgh</h3>
            <h2>Edinburgh, Athens of the North</h2>
            <p>
              Since the early 19th century, Edinburgh has been widely referred
              to as the "Athens of the North." This comparison began as early as
              the 1760s, with terms like "Athens of Britain" and "Modern Athens"
              being used. The similarities between the two cities were seen in
              both their topography and intellectual life. Edinburgh's Castle
              Rock was reminiscent of the Athenian Acropolis, while its
              neoclassical architecture and the layout of the New Town also drew
              comparisons. Both cities had flat, fertile agricultural land
              sloping down toward a port (Leith in Edinburgh, and Piraeus in
              Athens). The Scottish Enlightenment, which emphasized humanism and
              rationalism, was also influenced by Ancient Greek philosophy. In
              1822, artist Hugh William Williams showcased his paintings of
              Athens alongside those of Edinburgh, solidifying the parallel
              between the cities in the public's imagination.
